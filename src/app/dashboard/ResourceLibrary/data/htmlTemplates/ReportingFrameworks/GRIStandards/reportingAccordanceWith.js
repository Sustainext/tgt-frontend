                            Reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards enables an organization to provide a comprehensive picture of its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts. This allows information users to make informed assessments and decisions about the organization's impacts and its contribution to sustainable development. The organization must comply with all nine requirements in this section to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.

                            For each material topic, the organization needs to identify disclosures from the GRI Topic Standards to report. The organization is required to report only those disclosures relevant to its impacts in relation to a material topic. The organization is not required to report disclosures that are not relevant.

                            There is no requirement for a minimum number of disclosures to report from the Topic Standards. The number of disclosures that the organization reports is based on its assessment of which disclosures are relevant to its impacts in relation to a material topic.

                            The organization may need to use more than one Topic Standard to report on a material topic. In addition, not all disclosures in a Topic Standard may be relevant for the organization to report. For example, an organization identifies pay equality as a material topic. The organization determines that the following disclosures are relevant to report on the topic: Disclosure 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage in GRI 202: Market Presence 2016, and Disclosure 405-2 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men in GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity 2016. The organization is not required to report other disclosures from these Standards (e.g., Disclosure 202-2 Proportion of senior management hired from the local community in GRI 202), as these disclosures do not address the topic of pay equality.

However, the organization is required to list these disclosures in the GRI content index and provide 'not applicable' as the reason for omission for not reporting the disclosures.

For example, 2-15-b-iii in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 requires the organization to report whether conflicts of interest relating to the existence of controlling shareholders are disclosed to stakeholders. This requirement does not apply to organizations that do not have shareholders (e.g., foundations). In such cases, the organization is required to explain why the disclosure or the requirement does not apply to the organization. However, there may be cases where a disclosure or a requirement in a disclosure applies to the organization, but the organization does not have in place the item specified in the disclosure or in the requirement (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process). For example, 2-23-b in GRI 2 requires the organization to describe its policy commitment to respect human rights. This expectation applies to every organization. All organizations are expected to have a policy commitment to respect human rights, but not every organization may have developed such a policy commitment yet. If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item (e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the case. It does not need to provide the 'not applicable' reason for omission. In such cases, the organization can explain the reasons for not having this item or describe any plans to develop it. The disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the item does not exist.</span>

                        <p class="block font-regular leading-[20px] mb-2.5">
                            There may be cases where the organization has the item specified in a disclosure or in a requirement in a disclosure, but the information about the item is unavailable or incomplete. In such cases, the organization provides 'information unavailable / incomplete' as the reason for omission. For example, information is unavailable for Disclosure 305-3 in GRI 305: Emissions 2016 when the organization has other indirect (Scope 3) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but it has not collected data on its other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions yet.

                            When the organization cannot report part of the required information it means the information is incomplete. When the reported information does not cover the complete scope required by a disclosure (e.g., the information is missing for certain entities, sites, geographic locations), then the organization is required to provide 'information unavailable / incomplete' as the reason for omission. The organization must specify the entities, sites, geographic locations, etc., for which the required information is missing and cannot be reported.
                        </p>
                        <p class="block font-regular leading-[20px] mb-2.5">
                            The required information, or part of the required information, can be unavailable when, for example, it cannot be obtained or is not of adequate quality to report. This may be the case when the information is collected from another organization, such as a supplier.

                        <p class="block font-regular leading-[20px] mb-2.5">
                            The reasons 'confidentiality constraints' and 'information unavailable / incomplete' should only be used in exceptional cases. Using 'confidentiality constraints' and 'information unavailable / incomplete' frequently as reasons for omitting information reduces the credibility and usefulness of the organization's sustainability reporting. It does not align with the aim of reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards, which is to provide a comprehensive picture of the organization's most significant impacts.

The GRI content index provides an overview of the organization's reported information, shows where the reported information can be found, and helps information users access this information. The content index also shows which GRI Standards and disclosures the organization has used.
