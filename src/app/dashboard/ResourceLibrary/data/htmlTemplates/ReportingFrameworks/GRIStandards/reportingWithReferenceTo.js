                            An organization can report with reference to the GRI Standards if it cannot comply with all the requirements for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards. The organization should transition to reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards in time as it will provide a comprehensive picture of the organization's most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights. The organization can also report with reference to the GRI Standards if it uses selected GRI Standards, or parts of their content, to report information about specific topics for specific purposes, such as complying with a reporting regulation on climate change. The organization must comply with all three requirements in this section to report with reference to the GRI Standards. The organization should also apply the reporting principles specified in section 4 of this Standard to ensure highquality reporting. Additionally, the organization should explain how it manages its impacts for the topics it reports on using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.

                            The information reported using the GRI Standards can be published or made accessible in a range of formats (e.g., electronic, paper-based) across one or more locations (e.g., a standalone sustainability report, web pages, an annual report). The GRI content index provides an overview of the organization's reported information, shows where the reported information can be found, and helps information users access this information. The content index also shows which GRI Standards and disclosures the organization has used. Appendix 2 of this Standard provides guidance on how to prepare the GRI content index when reporting with reference to the GRI Standards. It includes an example that the organization can use to prepare the content index. The organization can use a different format for the content index than the one provided in Appendix 2, as long as it complies with the requirements for the content index. The organization can also use the content index specified for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards in Appendix 1 of this Standard, if suitable. In such a case, the statement of use in Appendix 1, which is for reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards, must be replaced by the statement of use for reporting with reference to the GRI Standards.
