              Energy intensity ratios define energy consumption in the context
              of an organization-specific metric. These ratios express the
              energy required per unit of activity, output, or any other
              organization specific metric. Intensity ratios are often called
              normalized environmental impact data.In combination with the
              organizationâ€™s total energy consumption, reported in Disclosures
              reported in Disclosures 302-1 and 302-2, energy intensity helps to
              contextualize the organizationâ€™s efficiency, including in relation
              to other organizations.

              Water quality refers to the physical, chemical, biological, and

              a human right. Water quality standards help uphold water quality
              in order to protect ecosystems, wildlife, and human health and
              welfare, and can be based on water properties, such as temperature
              or pH value. The specific choice of water quality standards and
              parameters can vary depending on an organizationâ€™s product,
              services, and facility locations, and can depend on national
              and/or regional regulations, as well as the profile of the
              receiving waterbody.

              Water stress refers to the ability, or lack thereof, to meet the
              human and ecological demand for water. Water stress can refer to
              the availability, quality, or accessibility of water. Publicly
              available and credible tools for assessing areas with water stress
              include the World Resources Institute â€˜Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas,'
              and the WWF 'Water Risk Filter'. Based on these tools, water
              stress in an area may be assessed using either of the following
              indicators and their thresholds:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
              <li className="text-[11px] text-[#727272]">
                he ratio of total annual water withdrawal to total available
                annual renewable water supply (i.e., baseline water stress) is
                high (40-80%) or extremely high (&lt; 80%)
              </li>
              <li className="text-[11px] text-[#727272]">
                he ratio of water consumption-to-availability (i.e., water
                depletion) is moderate (dry-year depletion, where for at least
                10% of the time, the monthly depletion ratio is &gt;75%), high
                (seasonal depletion, where for one month of the year on average,
                the depletion ratio is &gt;75%), or very high (ongoing
                depletion, where the depletion ratio on average is &gt;75%)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-2">
              The organization may use these indicators even though they account
              only for quantity and not the quality or accessibility of water as
              per the inclusive approach to the definition of water stress. The
              organization can complement the results from these tools with
              their own assessments, to provide more granular local-level data.
              Water stress in an area may be measured at catchment level at a
              minimum.

              Quantifying the volume of water discharge can help an organization
              understand its negativeimpacts on the receiving waterbody. The
              relationship between water discharge and negative impacts is not
              linear. An increase in the total volume of water discharge does
              not necessarily correspond to greater negative impacts, since
              these impacts depend on the quality of the water discharge and the
              sensitivity of the receiving waterbody. An organization with a
              high volume of water discharge, but also a high level of treatment
              and strict quality standards, can have positive impacts on the
              receiving waterbody. To learn more about locations where
              water-related impacts might be significant, and where actions to
              address them are most needed, the reporting organization can also
              report the information requested in Disclosure 303-4 for each

              change in water storage using the following formula: Change in
              water storage = Total water storage at the end of the reporting
              period - Total water storage at the beginning of the reporting

              community in the reporting period. Reporting the volume of water
              consumption can help the organization understand the overall scale
              of its impact due to water withdrawal on downstream water

              some of its business relationships (e.g., they apply only to
              suppliers), then the organization should report to which
              activities and business relationships the policies or commitments
              apply. It can also explain why the policies or commitments are
              limited to these activities and business relationships.

              commitments, or are encouraged (but not obligated) to do so. When
              its business relationships are encouraged to abide by the policies

              net gain of biodiversity, or to contribute to nature positive
              goals. In such a case, the organization should explain how it has

              reporting progress toward the goals and targets and assessing if
              the progress is satisfactory, the organization can, for example,
              report that it sourced 60% of deforestation-free products in 2023.

              impacts are taken. Impacts can be avoided by finding alternative
              locations for the activities (e.g., relocating the site), changing
              the timing of the activities (e.g., timing activities when they do
              not interfere with a species' breeding or migration), or by

              is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has

              process of stabilizing the terrain, ensuring public safety,
              enhancing aesthetics, and restoring the land to a purpose deemed
              useful within the regional context. Actions taken to restore and
              rehabilitate affected ecosystems aim to return the environment to
              its original state or to a state where it has a healthy and
              functioning ecosystem.

              the area targeted for restoration or rehabilitation is equivalent
              in size to the area that has been affected. â€˜Viableâ€™ means that no

              restoration and rehabilitation is that the land ownership is not
              limited in time. â€™Measurableâ€™ means that objectives have been
              defined and are regularly monitored. Stakeholder engagement can
              include co-design, co-management, co-governance, and regular and

              conservation outcomes are demonstrably new and additional and
              would not have resulted without the offset (e.g., weed control
              measures required by legislation cannot contribute to an offset).
              As no two areas are ecologically identical, â€˜ecological
              equivalenceâ€™ means that the biodiversity gains from the offset
              must be equivalent to the residual impacts. â€˜Permanenceâ€™ means

              to the duration of the biodiversity loss from the residual impacts

              Synergies include actions taken to protect biodiversity that
              contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation. Actions can
              also improve the capacity of species or ecosystems to adapt to
              unavoidable climate change impacts. For example, planting
              mangroves can protect biodiversity by increasing the wildlife
              population and contribute to climate change mitigation and
              adaptation by capturing and storing carbon and controlling floods.

              In contrast, trade-offs include climate change mitigation or
              adaptation actions that result in biodiversity loss. For example,
              foresting an area with non-native species may contribute to
              climate change mitigation and adaptation by absorbing greenhouse
              gases and controlling erosion. However, it may also result in the
              loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services that flow from the
              affected ecosystems.

              trade-offs between actions taken to manage its biodiversity and

              sufficient to comply with the requirement

              Actions taken to manage impacts on biodiversity may lead to
              negative impacts on stakeholders. For example, when an
              organizationâ€™s offset measures form a new protected area
              restricting the local community from using the area and accessing
              natural resources.

            <p className="text-[12px] text-[#727272] mb-2">
              The organization should report which stakeholders are affected or
              potentially affected and explain how it identifies, addresses, and
              monitors the negative and positive impacts on stakeholders. The
              organization should explain how it engages with stakeholders to
              identify and avoid negative impacts that are considered
              unacceptable and cannot be mitigated or compensated for. It should
              also describe the actions taken to achieve equitable social
              outcomes. For example, a privately owned protected area invests
              part of its revenue from tourism in local energy and healthcare
              projects, but it restricts local communities from utilizing the
              land for agricultural purposes. The organization should also
              explain how it engages with stakeholders and describe any conflict
              resolution or grievance mechanisms it has implemented. For more

              ecosystem conversion (e.g., deforestation-free policy). If the
              organization does not have such a policy in place, it should
              select a reference date to measure natural ecosystem conversion.
              For instance, if 2015 has been set as a cut-off date or reference
              date, the organization reports the size of the ecosystem converted
              from 2015 until the reporting period. Common cut-off dates apply
              to organizations operating in the same or similar context. They
              support the monitoring, verification, and management of natural
              ecosystem conversion, including in supply chains. Cut-off dates
              can, therefore, be selected based on sector-wide or regional
              cut-off dates (e.g., the 2008 cut-off date from the Brazil Soy
              Moratorium) or those specified in certification programs (e.g.,
              Forest Stewardship Council), legislation (e.g., EU regulation on
              deforestation-free products), or voluntary initiatives (e.g.,
              Science Based Targets for Nature). Cut-off dates may differ
              between commodities and regions. More guidance can be found in the
              Accountability Framework initiative Operational Guidance on Cutoff
              Dates [6]. The organization should explain why it has determined
              the cut-off or reference dates as appropriate.

              â€˜pressuresâ€™ or â€˜impact driversâ€™. The IPBES global assessment has
              identified land and sea use change and the exploitation of natural

              pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species. These

              Natural ecosystem conversion is measured from a cut-off date

              organization does not have such a policy in place, it should
              select a reference date to measure natural ecosystem conversion.
              For instance, if 2015 has been set as a cut-off date or reference
              date, the organization reports the size of the ecosystem converted
              from 2015 until the reporting period. Common cut-off dates apply

              ecosystem conversion, including in supply chains. Cut-off dates
              can, therefore, be selected based on sector-wide or regional
              cut-off dates (e.g., the 2008 cut-off date from the Brazil Soy

              This disclosure provides an understanding of the direct drivers of
              biodiversity loss (hereafter the direct drivers) leading to the
              most significant impacts. The organization should additionally
              report the information on the direct drivers for its downstream
              value chain.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
              Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), direct drivers are
              the drivers that â€˜unequivocally influence biodiversity and
              ecosystem processesâ€™. Direct drivers are sometimes referred to as
              â€˜pressuresâ€™ or â€˜impact driversâ€™. The IPBES global assessment has
              identified land and sea use change and the exploitation of natural
              resources as the main direct drivers, followed by climate change,
              pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species. These
              direct drivers can also lead to the fragmentation and degradation
              of ecosystems. See Box 1 for more information on direct drivers of
              biodiversity loss.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Information on the direct drivers informs decisions on
              prioritizing actions to manage biodiversityrelated impacts by
              applying the mitigation hierarchy. See Disclosure 101-2 for more
              information on the mitigation hierarchy. The organizationâ€™s
              actions to mitigate direct drivers are reported under Disclosure
              101-2.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Through its activities, an organization can use natural resources
              for its production processes (e.g., sand used in a construction
              project) or produce non-product outputs (e.g., pollutants or
              greenhouse gas emissions). These activities, responsible for the
              direct drivers of biodiversity loss, can have negative impacts on
              biodiversity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              The organization needs to report only the information for the
              direct drivers relevant to its activitiesand its supply chain.
              Direct drivers can vary by location. For example, an organization
              has activities in site A that lead to pollution. It also has
              activities in site B that lead to the exploitation of natural
              resources. In this case, the organization only needs to report the
              information on pollution for site A and on the exploitation of
              natural resources for site B.

              When reporting information on the affected or potentially affected
              ecosystems, the organization should consider all ecosystem types
              in the area that is or could be affected by its activities,
              including beyond its sites, if relevant. The state of the overall
              ecosystem, which extends beyond the areas affected by the
              organization, is not required for reporting. For example, an
              organization that owns a soy plantation in the Amazon is required
              to report information on the type, size, and condition of the
              affected part of the ecosystem rather than reporting on the entire
              Amazon region.

              The base year is when the organization collects baseline
              information on the ecosystem type, size, and condition. The base
              year may be the start of an organizationâ€™s activities, the date
              from which it owned, leased, or managed a particular site, or when
              it committed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss

              organizationâ€™s activities start. For more information on best

              The size and condition of an affected ecosystem can be combined
              into one unit: conditionadjusted area. This is the size of the
              ecosystem adjusted for its condition, and the unit (e.g.,
              equivalent hectares) represents the residual condition within that
              area. The organization can also report impacts on affected
              ecosystems using condition-adjusted hectares. See Align Measuring
              Ecosystem Condition â€“ A primer for business [50] and the
              Endangered Wildlife Trust Biological Diversity Protocol [16] for

              The activities of an organization may degrade the condition of
              affected ecosystems through the direct drivers of biodiversity
              loss (hereafter direct drivers). For example, the emission of
              pollutants, partial deforestation, or water withdrawal in an area
              with water stress, may affect the ecosystem's structure,
              composition, or function. If land and sea use change is the
              primary direct driver of biodiversity loss, the activities of an
              organization lead to the conversion of an ecosystem into a
              different type of ecosystem. In this case, the conversion of the

              Methods to measure ecosystem condition should reflect the relevant

              that directly measure characteristics or estimate ecosystem
              conditions based on direct drivers. These methods can be specific
              to certain types of ecosystems (e.g., types of wetlands or
              forests) or applicable to different ecosystem types (i.e.,
              applicable across terrestrial, freshwater, or marine realms).

              The organization should use primary data to report on direct
              drivers where possible (e.g., data collected through field
              surveys, eDNA, or derived from satellite imagery). When primary
              data is unavailable, the organization can use secondary or modeled
              data (e.g., data layers on ecosystem extent and condition, life
              cycle impact assessments). Modeled data are issued from models
              that quantify how the different direct drivers affect the state of
              biodiversity. These models use globally collected data, and the
              results are applied locally to estimate how the organizationâ€™s
              activities can lead to ecosystem changes. They include geospatial
              data layers that can be used to identify changes in the size and

              is the compilation of an asset inventory for each ecosystem type
              so that gains in one type do not compensate for losses in another.
              They are also useful in tracking progress against targets to halt

              The organizationâ€™s activities may lead to an increase or decrease
              in the quality and quantity of ecosystem services. For example,
              the organization can explain that cutting trees in the forest has
              decreased food provisioning services, which has a negative impact
              on the local community that needs to find an alternative food
              source. In another example, the organization can explain that
              switching to agroforestry has resulted in an increase in soil
              erosion control services, which has a positive impact on the local
              community that will face fewer risks from flooding.

              Ecosystem services occur through an ecosystem's normal functioning
              and can fall into one or more of the following categories:

              Provisioning services contribute to benefits extracted or
              harvested from ecosystems. Examples are timber in a forest,
              freshwater from a river, and subsistence hunting. Regulating and
              maintenance services result from the ability of ecosystems to
              regulate biological processes and influence climate, hydrological,
              and biochemical cycles, thereby maintaining environmental
              conditions beneficial to people. An example is the role of forests
              in preventing soil erosion. Cultural services are the non-material
              benefits people (beneficiaries) obtain from ecosystems through
              spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection,
              recreation, and aesthetic experiences. Examples are the
              recreational value of a forest and the cultural importance of a
              heritage landscape for a local community.{" "}

              Biodiversity plays an important role in maintaining the quality,
              quantity, and resilience of ecosystem service flows, and it
              provides ecosystem services that beneficiaries rely upon now and
              into the future. The diversity of genes, species, and ecosystems
              provides a greater range of ecosystem service and higher overall
              quantity, quality, and resilience of ecosystem services and
              improves the capacity of ecosystems to function effectively. A
              change in the state of biodiversity can lead to changes in
              ecosystem services. This, in turn, can have an impact on the
              beneficiaries of these ecosystem services. For example, a decline
              in the number of bees caused by the organizationâ€™s activities can
              lead to decreased pollination services. If the crops are not
              properly pollinated by the bees, the quality and quantity of the
              crops produced may be affected, reducing the available food for
              the local community that grows the crops.

              According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
              Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), direct drivers are
              the drivers that â€˜unequivocally influence biodiversity and
              ecosystem processesâ€™. Direct drivers are sometimes referred to as
              â€˜pressuresâ€™ or â€˜impact driversâ€™. The IPBES global assessment has
              identified land and sea use change and the exploitation of natural
              resources as the main direct drivers, followed by climate change,
              pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species. These
              direct drivers can also lead to the fragmentation and degradation
              of ecosystems. See Box 1 for more information on direct drivers of
              biodiversity loss.

              Information on the direct drivers informs decisions on
              prioritizing actions to manage biodiversityrelated impacts by
              applying the mitigation hierarchy. See Disclosure 101-2 for more
              information on the mitigation hierarchy. The organizationâ€™s
              actions to mitigate direct drivers are reported under Disclosure

              Through its activities, an organization can use natural resources
              for its production processes (e.g., sand used in a construction
              project) or produce non-product outputs (e.g., pollutants or
              greenhouse gas emissions). These activities, responsible for the
              direct drivers of biodiversity loss, can have negative impacts on
              biodiversity.

              Direct drivers can vary by location. For example, an organization
              has activities in site A that lead to pollution. It also has

              It may not be feasible for the organization to obtain primary data
              on direct drivers from suppliers. In such a case, the organization
              can estimate the direct drivers using multi-regional input-output
              models and lifecycle impact assessments in combination with data
              on the volume or amount spent on products and services.
              Multi-regional input-output models can provide estimates of the

              According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
              Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), direct drivers are
              the drivers that â€˜unequivocally influence biodiversity and
              ecosystem processesâ€™. Direct drivers are sometimes referred to as
              â€˜pressuresâ€™ or â€˜impact driversâ€™. The IPBES global assessment has
              identified land and sea use change and the exploitation of natural
              resources as the main direct drivers, followed by climate change,
              pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species. These
              direct drivers can also lead to the fragmentation and degradation
              of ecosystems. See Box 1 for more information on direct drivers of
              biodiversity loss.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Information on the direct drivers informs decisions on
              prioritizing actions to manage biodiversityrelated impacts by
              applying the mitigation hierarchy. See Disclosure 101-2 for more
              information on the mitigation hierarchy. The organizationâ€™s
              actions to mitigate direct drivers are reported under Disclosure
              101-2.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Through its activities, an organization can use natural resources
              for its production processes (e.g., sand used in a construction
              project) or produce non-product outputs (e.g., pollutants or
              greenhouse gas emissions). These activities, responsible for the
              direct drivers of biodiversity loss, can have negative impacts on
              biodiversity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              The organization needs to report only the information for the
              direct drivers relevant to its activitiesand its supply chain.
              Direct drivers can vary by location. For example, an organization
              has activities in site A that lead to pollution. It also has
              activities in site B that lead to the exploitation of natural
              resources. In this case, the organization only needs to report the
              information on pollution for site A and on the exploitation of
              natural resources for site B.

              Where possible, the organization should also report the location
              within the country or jurisdiction (e.g., state, city, Exclusive
              Economic Zone) or a precise location, such as polygon outlines or
              maps. The organization can report departure and arrival locations
              and transport routes for transport activities. For fishing
              activities, it can report FAO major fishing areas and subareas.

              For each product and service with the most significant impacts on
              biodiversity, the organization should describe the level of
              traceability in place, for example, whether the product or service
              can be traced to the national, regional, or local level, or a
              specific point of origin (e.g., farms). The organization can also
              report the volume sourced or the amount spent on each product and

              products and services in its supply chain with the most
              significant impacts on biodiversity. If the products in its supply
              chain are or contain high-impact commodities, the organization can
              report the quantity of each high-impact commodity sourced (e.g.,
              tons of avocado) and the proportion of total high-impact
              commodities sourced. This information provides a high-level
              understanding of the significance of biodiversity across products
              in the organizationâ€™s supply chain. The organization can use the
              SBTN High Impact Commodity List to identify whether it sources
              products that are or contain high-impact commodities. The
              proportion of total high-impact commodities sourced is calculated
              using the following formula:
